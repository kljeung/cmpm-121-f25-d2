# CMPM 121 D2 Project

## Step 1

- Added a header and ~~stole~~ 'borrowed' the canvas code from https://github.com/rndmcnlly/cmpm-121-f25-quaint-paint/blob/main/paint0.html

## Step 2

- added drawing and a clear canvas function

## Step 3

- added an array to store all points drawn

## Step 4

- added undo/redo buttons and functionality

## Step 5

- added display commands

## Step 6

- added more marker sizes (plus a button to switch between the two)

## Step 7

- added a preview circle for tool sizes

## Step 8

- added stickers, the ability to move them (albeit it is a bit janky, you can drag any sticker as long as you are using 1 of the 3 sticker tools, though it lags a bit), and refactored my redrawing code as it did not function well with the new stickers

## Step 9

- added custom stickers and optimized sticker code

## Step 10

- added the ability to export your creations

## Step 11

- made it pretty and changed the emotes/brush sizes

## Step 12

- added a random color function to brushes (only swaps colors randomly when user picks a new tool)
